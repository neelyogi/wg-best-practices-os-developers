WHAT ARE OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS



Tools that are free for open-source projects in each
of the above categories are all listed one by one in
the upcoming slides.

Open source Security tools are free resources used
for security testing purposes






REQUIREMENT FOR SECURITY TESTING

Security testing also known as penetration testing is
a a pro-active way of testing the security of the
organization’s network, web, applications and all IT
resources.

Computer security experts, also known as white
hackers are using these types of tools to be able to
detect , and address security vulnerabilities in a
computer application.

You could actually say that penetration testing is
much like hiring security consultants to attempt a
security attack on a secure facility to find out how
real hackers might go about doing the actual thing.





TYPES OF OPEN-SOURCE CYBERSECURITY TOOLS FOR SECURITY
TESTING

Password protection tools

Network scanning and security tools

Web server security tools

Code scanning tools

DB Security tools

Intrusion Detection tools

Vulnerability assessment tools

Security monitoring and logging tools

OWASP tools





PASSWORD MANAGERS



What are password managers and why they are
needed?



These tools provide encrypted digital vaults that are
developed to store secure password login information
which is used for accessing apps and accounts on mobile
devices, websites, and also other devices.

Along with keeping identity, credentials, and sensitive
data safe, the password manager can generate strong,
and unique passwords and ensure that users aren’t using
the same password in so many different places (password
generation really comes in handy when users are unable
to come up with yet a matchless password)

Password managers offers to keep multiple passweord
safe and reduces the password reset requests for IT
support personnel





Here are a few lists of some open-source password
managers

1. KeePass (OS)

2. Passbolt (OS)

3. Psono (OS)

4. Password Safe (OS)

5. Bitwarden (OS)





WELL-KNOWN NETWORK SECURITY TESTING TOOLS


Nmap

For reconnaissance, this is the preferred opensource tool, it can quickly scan large networks and runs on all
major OSes.

Wireshark

This is a popular network protocol analyzer that is supported on all the main OSes. It helps with live
capture, decryption support and offline analysis for every key network protocol

Jok3r

Another framework for network infrastructure and web pen testing is Jok3r which is a collection of more
than 50 open-source tools and scripts

Legion

Legion is an open source, easy-to-use, super-extensible and semi-automated network penetration testing




WEB SERVER SECURITY SCANNING TOOLS



A web application security scanner is a software which performs automatic black-box testing on a web application and identifies
security vulnerabilities. There are plenty of tools, but listing some of the commonly used tools for web applications.

Zed Attack Proxy

OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) scans web applications for vulnerabilities..

Nikto

Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including testing for over
6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of servers, and version specific problems

Wfuzz

Developed in Python, Wfuzz is popularly used for brute-forcing web applications. The open-source security testing tool has no GUI interface but only
command line

Wapiti

This is used to check web applications for security vulnerabilities, Wapiti performs black box testing. As it is a command-line application, it is important to
have a knowledge of various commands used by Wapiti.

W3af

w3af is an open-source web application security scanner. The project provides a vulnerability scanner and exploitation tool for Web applications. It
provides information about security vulnerabilities for use in penetration testing





ADDITIONAL SECURITY TOOLS


Code Scanning tools checks for the quality of the code and checks of security issues before it is deployed into the server

SonarQube

SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews
with static analysis of code to detect bugs and code smells on 29 programming

Horusec

It performs code scanning that will check if there is any vulnerability or security issue

DB security tools checks for vulnerabilities with database servers.

Sql

SQLMap is a tool used for the automated exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities. We can use SQLMap to test websites and databases
for vulnerabilities and exploit those vulnerabilities to take over the database.

NoSQL

NoSQLMap is an opensource Python tool designed to audit for as well as automate injection attacks and exploit default configuration
weaknesses in NoSQL databases, as well as web applications using NoSQL in order to disclose data from the database. The current project
goals are to provide a penetration testing tool to simplify attacks on MongoDB servers and web applications as well as proof of concept
attacks to debunk the premise that NoSQL applications are impervious to SQL injection.
