OPEN-SOURCE SECURITY
TOOLS


PASSWORD MANAGERS

These are usually encrypted digital vaults that are developed
to store secure password login information which is used for
accessing apps and accounts on mobile devices, websites, and
also other devices.

Aside from keeping our identity, credentials, and sensitive data
safe, the best password manager generator that is able to
create such strong, and unique passwords and ensure that
users aren’t using the same password in so many different
places (password generation really comes in handy when users
are unable to come up with yet a matchless password on the
fly for the latest must-have iOS app).

Just looking at the phishing attacks, it’s easy to understand
why having a matchless password for each location can go a
long way in protecting you – if a password is stolen, then it
means that it is matchless, and it also cannot be used on other
sites. We are basically using multiple passwords to create our
own security features.



Here are a few lists of some open-source password managers

PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS

When it comes to the network security game these
free, and open-source cybersecurity tools are some
of the most valuable tools around. The process is
known in common terms as pen-testing.

Computer security experts, also known as white
hackers are using these types of tools to be able to
detect , and also take advantage of security
vulnerabilities in a computer application.

You could actually say that penetration testing is
much like hiring security consultants to attempt a
security attack on a secure facility to find out how
real gangsters might go about doing the actual thing.
On the market, there are a few good free tools.



HIDS TOOLS

HIDS stands for Host-based intrusion detection
system. HIDS basically represents an application
monitoring a computer or network for various
suspicious activities.

Most of the activities that are monitored will be
included bit it many not be limited to intrusions that
are created by external actors and also by a misuse
of resources or data internally.

HIDS work by logging the suspicious activity, and
also reporting it to the administrators managing the
devices or networks.



THREAT DETECTION SECURITY TOOLS

A lot of cybersecurity practices can be covered by a
term such as threat protection. Now, we need to
take into account that every step we make into
cybersecurity matters. It comes together as a whole
from the policies you adapt to the way we educate
employees, and all the way through to the solutions
you integrate to defend your system, which can be
paid, free or open source cybersecurity tools.

SECURITY ONION

Description of security onion

The first tool on the list is an open-source Linux distribution that targets
security monitoring. It comes with a host of built-in tools (for example.,
Snort, Suricata) designed to help you monitor a user's environment for
security-relevant activity at multiple levels of the stack. One of the
advantages that using the distribution has, over just installing and using
the underlying toolset directly, is that Security Onion a term called
helpful setup wizard. Even if the organization doesn’t have an army of
security operations staff, the tool allows users to still stand up a
full-featured monitoring solution in relatively little time. Also, because
campus environments can be both wide, and workable (for example as
learning-oriented environments might be set up for particular purposes),
using this tool has the dominance of a “drop-in”, short-term monitoring
solution for a momentary environment without incurring additional
hardware or licensing costs.



CUCKOO SANDBOX

Description of Cuckoo Sandbox

One of the matchless things about higher ed is that there’s a
enormous percentage of students who, well let’s just say have a
love of hijinks. Therefore, suspicious files – many of which may not
match a known malware signature – may rise and require further
investigation. Sometimes IT departments may just need to answer
the question called “Is this thing malware or not?” One of the
easiest to do this is to run it in a sandbox and see if it causes
adverse effects. The Cuckoo Sandbox helps do exactly that. It
provides a sandbox environment where users can open a suspicious
looking file to be able to see what it does: files it opens, network
connections it makes, resources it allocates. Really squeezing the
most value out of the tool will indeed require technical acumen that
smaller institutions may not have at their disposal. However, using
this tool just top see whether a given program is malware or not is
quick and relatively straightforward.

DOCKER

Description of Docker

Docker is included in the security tools list even though that it is not a tool
primarily concentrated on security alone. The reason it is included is
because of the potential security benefit that can arise through using it. The
Docker Community Edition (Docker CE) is a tool that allows users to
create “containers” – lightweight, portable modules within which
applications can run. Just like with OS virtualization, multiple applications
living in different containers can be running next to each other on the same
container engine runtime. How is this useful for security practitioners?
There are a few ways. Aside, from being a way to help better manage
application deployment (always a good thing, and also valuable from a
security point of view), it also can help make accessible other security tools
that might have been overly complex to install and get running without it
(in fact, you’ll see an example of this next). There’s not enough space in a
short article like this one for a full background on how to use Docker to
get maximum value in the shop but serve it to say that it’s a tool worth
getting to know.

OPENVAS

Description of OpenVAS

In the past, it was undecided that suggesting to educational
institutions the OpenVAS open-source vulnerability scanner.
Why? Not because it isn’t a great tool. In the contrary, it’s
been one of the go-to options since it forked from Nessus
back in the day. The reason with that being is because,
historically, installing it and getting into an operational state
can be complicated. Nowadays though, because of
containerization environments like Docker (take a look at the
previous slide), you can stand up a fully functional instance (or
nearly so) with just one command. For those organizations
that need to boost their vulnerability assessment capability in
a touch (and who doesn’t?), using OpenVAS – particularly
pre-packaged containers – is well within the reach of even
those organizations with limited technical staff.


NIPAP

Description of NIPAP

What do campuses have a lot of? IP address space. Keeping
track of what IPs are associated with what URLs in DNS,
what ranges are assigned to what pools in DHCP, what static
addresses are assigned to what devices, and so on can be
logistical nightmare when one is talking about a network
landscape as complex, large, and fluid as a typical campus.
Keeping track of this very critical for security as well as (of
course) for technical management and operations purposes.
Relatively simple to position and use, the open-source IP
addresses management tool NIPAP (Neat IP Address Planner)
can help bring order to the chaos by helping you keep track
of what’s assigned where, and it can help with subnetting, and
otherwise help replace the difficult Excel spreadsheets in use
now in nonexistence of a planning tool for this purpose.



INTRODUCTION

The OWASP’s (Open Web Application Security Project) operation is to help the world improve the security of its
software. One of the best ways OWASP can do that to help Open-Source developers to improve the software they are
creating that everyone else relies on. By itself, the following lists of automated vulnerability detection tools that are free
for open-source projects that have been gathered together here to raise awareness of their availabilities.

It would be best to encourage Open-Source projects to use the following types of tools to be able to improve the security
and quality of their code:

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools (primarily meant for web apps)

Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Tools – (primarily meant for web apps and web APIs)

Keeping Open-Source libraries up to date (this is meant to avoid using components with unknown vulnerabilities
(OWASP Top 10-2017 A9))

Static code quality tools




FREE FOR OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS

Tools that are free for open-source projects in each
of the above categories are all listed one by one in
the upcoming slides.




SAST TOOLS

OWASP already keeps a page of known SAST tools:
Source Code Analysis Tools, which includes a list of
those that are “Open-Source of Free Tools of this
type”. Any such tools could certainly be used.

GitHub code scanning – It is free for open static
analysis service that uses GitHub Actions and
CodeQL to scan public sources on GitHub. This all
supports C/C++, C#, Ruby (beta), Java,
JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Go (click this link
https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/sup
ported-languages-and-frameworks/ for more info)




DAST TOOLS

If your project has a web application component, then it is
recommended that running automated scans against it to look
for vulnerabilities. OWASP maintains a page of known DAST
tools, and the License column on this page indicates which of
those tools have free capabilities. The most primary
recommendation is to use one of these listed below:

OWASP ZAP – This is a full featured free and open source
DAST tool that includes both automated scanning for
vulnerabilities and tools to assist expert manual web app pen
testing.

Stack Hawk - 2 Stack Hawk is commercially used to support
DAST tool built on OWASP ZAP and it is optimized to run in
CI/CD (almost every CI is supported) to test web applications
during development and in CI/CD. The Stack Hawk platform
allows a user to manage findings over time in different
environments.




IAST TOOLS

IAST tools are normally pitched to analyze web
applications and Web APIs, but that is vendor specific.
There may be IAST products that can perform good
security analysis on non-web applications as well.

Contrast Community edition (CE) – Fully featured
version for 1 app and up to 5 users (some Enterprise
features disabled). Contrast CE supports Java and
also .NET only.

API web scanners

For tools which are API specific users should refer to
the OWASP community API security tools page.




CODE QUALITY TOOLS

Quality has a significant connection to security. As
such, it is recommended that open-source projects also
consider using good code quality tools. There are a few
tips that we should be aware of, and that are:

Spot Bugs – Open-source code quality tool for Java

This is the active fork for Find Bugs, so if users use Find
Bugs, they should switch to Spot Bugs

Spot Bug users need to add the Find Sec Bugs plugin
(https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) to their Spot Bugs
setup, as it is meaningly improving on the very basic
security checking native to Spot Bugs.



Hope you found all this info useful!
