Cybersecurity for school and
education institutions and non-profit

Like any business, security is very important for schools and education
institutions and non-profit organizations

Along with protecting all other IT assets with network security and other tools
education institutes need to protect the student information and their grades

For non-profit, protecting user information is very critical

Most of such information will be stored in Database. Hence database security is
critical

Even within the organization they need to protect the information only for people
who need to know

In security it is called access based on ‘need to know’ basis

This is achieved by having proper access control
