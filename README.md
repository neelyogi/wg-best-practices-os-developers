Open-Source Security Tools


What are Open-Source Tools?
  
  Tools are free for open-source projects in each of the above categories are all listed by one by one in the upcoming slides.
  Open Source Security Tools are free resources used for security testing purposes
  
  
  Requirement for security testing
  
  What is security testing or penetration testing and why they are needed?
  
  Security testing also known as penetration is a pro-active way of testing the security of the organization's network, web applications and all IT resources.
  Computer security experts, also known as white hackers are using these types of tools to be able to detect, and address security vulnerabilites in a computer application.
  You could actually say that penetration testing is much like hiring security consultants to attempt a security attack on a secure facility toi find out how real hackers might go about doing the actual thing.
  
  
  
  
  Types of Open-Source cybersecurity tools for security testing
  
  Password protection tools
  Network scanning and security tools
  Web server security tools
  Code scanning tools
  DB Security tools
  Intrusion Detection tools
  Vulnerability assessment tools
  Security monitoring and logging tools
  OWASP tools
  
  
  Password Managers
  
  What are password managers and why are they needed?
  
  These tools provide encrupted digital vaults that are developed to store secure password login information which is used for accessing apps and accounts on mobile devices, websites, and also other devices.
  Along with keeping identity, credentials, and sensitive data safe, the password manager can generate strong, and unique passwords and ensure that users aren't using the same password in so many different places (password generation really comes in handy when users are unable to come up with yet a matchless password)
  Password managers offers to keep multiple password safe and reduces the password reset requests for IT support personnel
  
  Here are a fee lists of some open-source password managers:
  1. KeePass (OS)
  2. Passbolt (OS)
  3. Psono (OS)
  4. Password Safe (OS)
  5. Bitwarden (OS)
  
  
  
  Nmap
  
  For reconnaissance, this is the preferred open-sourcetool, it can quickly scan large networks and run on all major OSes.
  
  Wireshark
  
  This is a popualar network protocol analyzer that is supported on all the main OSes. It helps with live capture, decryption support and offline analysis for every key network protocol
  
  Jok3r
  
  Another framework for network infrastructure and web pen testing is Jok3r which is a collection of more than 50 open-source tools and scripts
  
  Legion
  
  Legion is an open-soucre, easy-to-use, super extensible and semi-automated network penetration testing
  
  
  
  Web Server Security Scanning Tools
  
  A web application security scanner is a software which performs automatic black-box testing on a web application and identifies security vulnerabilites. There are plenty of tools, but listing some of the commonly used tools for web application.
  
  Zed Attack Proxy
  
  OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) scans web applications for vulnerabilites..
  
  Nikto
  
  Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including testing for over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of servers, and version specific problems
  
  Wfuzz 
  
  Developed in Python, Wfuzz is popularly used for brute-forcing web applications. The open-source security testing has no GUI interferance but only command line
  
  Wapiti
  
  This is used to check web application for security vulnerabilites, Wapiti performs black box testing. As it is command-line application, it is important to have a knowledge pf various commands used by Wapiti.
  
  W3af
  
  W3af is an open-source web application security scanner. The project provides a vulnerability scanner and exploitation tool for Web applications. It provides information about security vulnerabilites for use in penetration testing.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Code Scanning Tools checks for the quality of the code and checks of security issues before it is deployed into the server
  
  SonarQube
  
  SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continousous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs and code smells on 29 programming
  
  Horusec
  
  It performs code scanning that will check if there is any vulnerability or security issue
  
  DB security tools check for vulnerabilites with dataservers.
  
  Sql
  
  SqlMap is a tool used for the automated explotation of SQL injection vulnerabilites. We can use SQLMap to test websites and databases for vulnerabilites and exploit those vulnerabilites to take over the database.
